STORAGE CONVENTION:

All the scene directories shall be stored in Scenes/

In the scene directories(e.g. Scene5/), the following files are presented:

editorPhyScene.txt emptyScene.txt fgColor_scene1.txt fgColor_scene2.txt phyScene.txt scene1.txt scene2.txt sceneCombined.txt




INTRO:

In the above files, scene1 and scene2 stores the look of the scenes. In the real game, scene2 is put on top of scene1,
creating a covering effect. 

fgColor_scene1 and fgColor_scene2 stores the color of respective scenes.
where Color Codes Are:
a is black
r is red
g is green
y is yellow
b is blue
m is magenta(a kind of red)
c is cyan(a kind of blue)
w is white(but try not to use it, because by default, text is white)
n is no color
space is no color
others: no color(but try not to use other characters in color files, use n or space instead)

phyScene is the file storing which part has physical effect.
where:
p is platform(you can penetrate platform jumping up)
g or G is ground(you cannot penetrate it under any condition)
others: ground(but try to use G or g only)

sceneCombined is intermediate file which is scene1 scene2 and phyScene combined that shall be generated by makeEditor.sh

!!!
editorPhyScene is where we edit phyScene(Yes! Don't edit phyScene directly! This will be introduced later)




EDITING:

1. Initializing
Create a new scene directory(e.g. NewScene/)
run:

./../initScene.sh widthOfScene heightOfScene

to create all the files you needed, be sure widthOfScene is larger than Camera width, and heightOfScene is larger than
Camera height(which is currently(11.5) 150 and 40)
Be sure to add .. since initScene.sh is at parent directory
(if you entered wrong width or height, just run the command again)

run:

ls

than you shall see all the required files being created


2. Backup

"file" described in the following DO NOT includes .txt extension

run:

./../backup.sh file

to backup a file. This will create a file with .bak extension to it

run:

./../restore.sh file

to copy file.bak to file, restoring the backup

run:

./../backupAll.sh

to delete all .bak files in directory and creating .bak files for the rest


3. Writing Figure to Files

DO NOT include .txt extension for file name
run:

./../writeFig.sh sceneFileName FigureFileName xPosition yPosition colorCode

to write a figure to sceneFile(scene1 or scene2)
Figure Files are stored in Figures/
ColorCode is described above, write n if it is white or no color
This writes the figure to sceneFile where the top left corner of the figure is at (xPosition,yPosition)
(for some reason, position at 0 cannot work, so don't write 0)


4. Editing Scene

run:

./../makeEditor.sh

to Make the editorPhyScene.txt(this will add scene2 on top of scene1 outputing sceneCombined, and then add phyScene on
top of that)

REPLACE the characters by 'p' at where you want to put platform
REPLACE the character by 'g' or 'G' at where you want to put ground

when you finished, run:

./../compileEditor.sh platformLook sceneFileStoringPlatform platformColorCode

to put everything you edited back in place
where platformLook is how platform is looked(e.g. -), sceneFileStoringPlatform is where you store the platform(e.g.
scene1)
