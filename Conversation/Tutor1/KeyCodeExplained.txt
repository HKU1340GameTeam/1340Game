You may see some key codes during the game
These are hints to you on how to pass the challenge
A [-] means a normal interval, a [=] means a short interval
For example, <left>=<jump>-<stand>, means pressing left and immediately jump, and then press stand
Normally, you are required to press <jump> immediately after you press moving
In the later course of the game you also need to use a lot of dash
